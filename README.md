# Hello-World
Where I store ideas and resources. Open to discussion.
  Im a 21 year old Cuban-American thats sole mission is to make the world a better place- as cliche as that sounds. I have been raised up in miami since two years old with a single mother and my two maternal grandparents. As a result, I have a keen passion towards croquetas and romantic music. On a serious note, I understand the value of hardwork and the experience people from different origins can offer. im currently a web developer with experience in JavaScript, CSS, HTML,Ruby,SQL and Python. As a programmer I emphasize building unique and creative projects that connects the user to beauty, passion and maybe some humor. Since picking up my first gaming device, the Game Cube, ive realized the joy,tears,laughs and screams that a game can offer, and even though at a low-level it is just software, the end product is so much more. This is my mentality as a Software Engineer, so please, come join.
